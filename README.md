### **Favorite Species**

Dianara:

My favorite species is the African Marigold. They are popular in the
gardening community because of their believed natural insecticide
qualities. They allegedly naturally attract competitors to common garden
pests. While there is little scientific backing to this, marigolds do
produce a toxin to nematodes, which are parasitic worms that attack
plant roots. They are low maintenance and make any garden stand out with
their bright colors.
