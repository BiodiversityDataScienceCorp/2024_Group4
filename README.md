### **Favorite Species**

Dianara:

My favorite species is the African Marigold. They are popular in the
gardening community because of their believed natural insecticide
qualities. They allegedly naturally attract competitors to common garden
pests. While there is little scientific backing to this, marigolds do
produce a toxin to nematodes, which are parasitic worms that attack
plant roots. They are low maintenance and make any garden stand out with
their bright colors.

Hayley:
My favorite species is the giant panda. They live in China and about 1,500 are
left living in the wild. Their diet consists of almost completely bamboo. They
eat over 20 pounds of bamboo each day to get all of their nutrients. They have 
no natural predators, although their cubs are susceptible to animals such as 
snow leopards and jackals. This species is threatened due to human activities 
such as poaching and habitat destruction. However, there is positive news in 
that the number of wild pandas is recovering and their species status has been 
changed from "endangered" to "vulnerable."
