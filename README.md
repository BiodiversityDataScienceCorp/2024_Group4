#Group 4 SSA / Species Distribution Modeling

**Group Members: Dianara Sagastizado, Grace Blunck, Hayley Krepps, and Kaia Hirsch**

Group species:

### **Favorite Species**

Grace: My favorite species is the shiras moose. There are four different subspecies of the moose found in North America; the eastern, the northwestern, the shiras and the Alaskan moose. Aside from the differences in geographical distribution, the different subspecies of moose are further distinguished by features such as size, pelage, and antler characteristics. Moose primarily eat deciduous shrubs. The moose is the tallest, and the second-largest, land animal in North America, falling short only of the American bison in body mass.

Dianara:

My favorite species is the African Marigold. They are popular in the gardening community because of their believed natural insecticide qualities. They allegedly naturally attract competitors to common garden pests. While there is little scientific backing to this, marigolds do produce a toxin to nematodes, which are parasitic worms that attack plant roots. They are low maintenance and make any garden stand out with their bright colors.

Hayley: My favorite species is the giant panda. They live in China and about 1,500 are left living in the wild. Their diet consists of almost completely bamboo. They eat over 20 pounds of bamboo each day to get all of their nutrients. They have no natural predators, although their cubs are susceptible to animals such as snow leopards and jackals. This species is threatened due to human activities such as poaching and habitat destruction. However, there is positive news in that the number of wild pandas is recovering and their species status has been changed from "endangered" to "vulnerable."
